# Chrome Screen Time

A Chrome Extension to limit my daily screen time, particularly on Youtube.
This was primarily a little project to learn a bit about how Chrome Extensions work, 
but I'm fairly hesitant about giving extensions permissions on my computer, 
so building it from scratch was a way for me to feel safe that this extension would be secure. 

Since this is just a personal project, I haven't published it, to install it you need to clone the repo
and, set your Chrome extensions to development mode, and add the folder.
